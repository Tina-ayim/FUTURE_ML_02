# FUTURE_ML_02
ML model to predict customer churn and visualize churn drivers(Churn Prediction System)

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning internship with Future Interns. The goal was to develop a churn prediction model to help businesses identify customers likely to leave a service.

## Features
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Classification with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, precision, recall)
- Churn driver visualizations using Matplotlib
- Business-focused output and insights

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

##  Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
